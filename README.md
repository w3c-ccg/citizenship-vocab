## Citizenship Vocabulary Specification

This specification describes a Linked Data vocabulary for asserting
Verifiable Credentials related to citizenship information, such as
given name, family name, country of citizenship, birthday, and other
attributes used to determine the citizenship status of a citizen.

We encourage contributions meeting the [Contribution
Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).  While we prefer the creation of issues
and Pull Requests in the GitHub repository, discussions often occur
on the
[public-credentials](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/)
mailing list as well.

### Testing Examples

The example Verifiable Credentials are available in the [`examples/`](examples/)
folder and can be tested directly using various tools such as the
[JSON-LD CLI](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/jsonld-cli).

```sh
$ npm i -g jsonld-cli
$ jsonld lint examples/ead.jsonld
```
